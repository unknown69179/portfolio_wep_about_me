# My Portfolio

---

I created this portfolio early on in my learning journey. It showcases my skills and highlights what I’m usually good at.

It includes three of my early projects. Since then, my projects and styling have improved significantly. At the time of making this portfolio, I didn’t have many projects yet, unfortunately.

Also, none of the projects are optimized for mobile screen sizes yet. As you can see, I am really good with animations — it's where my creativity shines.
